# RLD Pro

> Practising _"Red Letter Day"_ (RLD) skip made easy!

This map aims to provide an easier way to practise _"the RLD skip"_,
since, as you know, loading the game after you have activated the skip crashes 
it.

## Features

- Save at any time during practising
- Teleport back on top of the wall when dying from falling
- Have different modes (routes) to practise

### 1. Window route

This route expects you to return to the window after you have successfully 
went throught the right spot on the map.

- Spawn on top of the wall

#### Goals

- Make it to the window

### 2. Change level route

This route expects you to hit the right spot because right after that you will go
to the next level preserving the velocity, so you can practise _"the landing"_.

- Spawn on top of the wall

#### Goals 

- Make it to the right spot
- Land on the roof in the next level

### 3. The trigger

This is the most precise part of the skip - you have to place the pallet in the right spot.

- Spawn in the room before the hallway

#### Goals

- Place the pallet in the right spot
