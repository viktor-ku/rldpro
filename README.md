# RLD Pro

> Practising _"Red Letter Day"_ (RLD) skip made easy!


#### The most annoying things

1. Not being able to save
2. Not knowing if you actually got your hitbox in the 
    right place before leaving the area

#### The most difficult things to practise are:

1. Getting the right velocity in the right place
2. Getting back from the area into the window
3. Getting the pallet in the right spot in the hallway at the end
4. Landing on the roof at the next level


This map aims to provide ways to practise the most difficult things
easier, while solving the _not being able to save_ anooyance, by skipping the
part with the bucket.

If I can get a way to know the ducking state and velocity upon trigger hit 
at the end of the area I will provide a way of knowing if you hit the right spot.


## Features

It's one map, but you can use buttons to 

1. Toggle markup on/off
2. Choose window or straight jump route

### 1. Jump to the window

> `rld_window.bsp`

Your usual route, you have to go throught the area and get to the window

### 2. To the next level

> `rld_jump.bsp`

Two maps merged into one, allowing you to practise landing straight from the wall, 
without having to touch the changelevel trigger.

### 3. Hallway

> Maybe in the future

Map that allows you to get a feeling for the pallet touch, instead of rellying on the
info stats.
