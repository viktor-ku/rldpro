# RLD Pro

> Practising _"Red Letter Day"_ (RLD) skip made easy!

This map aims to provide an easier way to practise _"the RLD skip"_,
since, as you know, loading the game after you have activated the skip crashes 
it.


#### The most annoying things

1. Not being able to save
2. Not knowing if you actually got your hitbox in the 
    right place before leaving the area

#### The most difficult things to practise are:

1. Getting the right velocity in the right place
2. Getting back from the area into the window
3. Getting the pallet in the right spot in the hallway at the end
4. Landing on the roof at the next level


This map aims to provide ways to practise the most difficult things
easier, while solving the _not being able to save_ anooyance, by skipping the
part with the bucket.

If I can get a way to know the ducking state and velocity upon trigger hit 
at the end of the area I will provide a way of knowing if you hit the right spot.


## Features

You can teleport to any of these practising points from the starting room at the beginning
of the `rldpro_01.bsp` map.

### 1. Wall to the window

- Your usual route, you have to go throught the area and get to the
    window

### 2. Wall to the next level

- Go straight to the next level without having to go throught the window
    * can be useful to test your angle and velocity

### 3. Hallway

- Perfect position & velocity after level change
- You get to this route after you go throught the elevator 
    after _"Wall to the window"_ route
